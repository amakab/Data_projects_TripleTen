## Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. Profit & Loss Drivers

- **Top Profit Centers:**  
  - **Copiers**, **Phones**, and **Accessories** were the most profitable subcategories across all regions.
- **Top Loss Drivers:**  
  - **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and **Supplies** consistently led to the largest losses.

 *Recommendation:* The superstore should **focus on top-performing categories** (e.g., Copiers, Phones) and **eliminate or revise offerings** in loss-making categories (e.g., Tables).

### 2. Product Termination Candidates

- **Highest Loss-Producing Products:**  
  - GBC DocuBind P400  
  - Cubify CubeX 3D Printer  
  - Bush Advantage Collection Table

*Recommendation:* These products should be **discontinued** due to their consistent negative profit margins.

---

### 3. Subcategory Focus Strategy

- **Focus On:**  
  - Copiers  
  - Phones  
  - Accessories  
- **Phase Out:**  
  - Supplies  
  - Bookcases  
  - Tables

*Strategy:* Realign inventory and marketing to prioritize high-yield categories.

### 4. Advertising Optimization

- Analyzed **monthly profit trends by state** to identify high-ROI advertising opportunities.
- **Best State-Month Combinations:**  
  - **Indiana in October** â†’ Willing to spend: `$128.60`  
  - **Rhode Island in December** â†’ Willing to spend: `$50.00`  
  - **Vermont in November** â†’ Willing to spend: `$119.20`  

*ROI Rule:* Willing to spend up to **1/5 of monthly profits** on advertising.

### 5. Returns Analysis

- **Most Returned Products:**  
  - KI Adjustable-Height Table  
  - Global Leather Task Chair  
  - Advantus Push Pins

- **Customers with Highest Return Rates:**  
  - Seth Vernon  
  - William Brown  
  - Ted Butterfield

 *Recommendation:* Investigate repeat returners and poor-performing SKUs for quality or fulfillment issues.

### 6. State-Level Strategy

- **States with High Losses & Return Rates:**  
  Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida
