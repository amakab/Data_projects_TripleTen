## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. 💸 Profit & Loss Drivers

- **Top Profit Centers:**  
  - **Copiers**, **Phones**, and **Accessories** were the most profitable subcategories across all regions.
- **Top Loss Drivers:**  
  - **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and **Supplies** consistently led to the largest losses.

📌 *Recommendation:* The superstore should **focus on top-performing categories** (e.g., Copiers, Phones) and **eliminate or revise offerings** in loss-making categories (e.g., Tables).

### 2. 🛑 Product Termination Candidates

- **Highest Loss-Producing Products:**  
  - GBC DocuBind P400  
  - Cubify CubeX 3D Printer  
  - Bush Advantage Collection Table

📌 *Recommendation:* These products should be **discontinued** due to their consistent negative profit margins.

### 3. 📦 Subcategory Focus Strategy

- **Focus On:**  
  - Copiers  
  - Phones  
  - Accessories  
- **Phase Out:**  
  - Supplies  
  - Bookcases  
  - Tables

📌 *Strategy:* Realign inventory and marketing to prioritize high-yield categories.

### 4. 📈 Advertising Optimization

- Analyzed **monthly profit trends by state** to identify high-ROI advertising opportunities.
- **Best State-Month Combinations:**  
  - **Indiana in October** → Willing to spend: `$128.60`  
  - **Rhode Island in December** → Willing to spend: `$50.00`  
  - **Vermont in November** → Willing to spend: `$119.20`  

📌 *ROI Rule:* Willing to spend up to **1/5 of monthly profits** on advertising.
