Zomato Sales Analysis – Power BI Final Project

Project Overview

**Objective**: Analyze the sales performance of restaurants on Zomato to uncover trends, identify top performers, and deliver actionable insights for improving revenue.

As part of my onboarding assignment as a Junior Analyst at Zomato, I selected the **Sales Analysis** track—one of three core analytical areas defined by the BI-Analytics Team. The analysis focuses on understanding revenue trends, evaluating restaurant performance, and identifying seasonal behaviors using historical order data.
